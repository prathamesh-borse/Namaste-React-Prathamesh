Ignite - Bundle Our Code so that It become ready to push into the production.

npx create react app - When you do this the app is already ignited and very much bunded application.

npm = node package manager first thing you had in mind.

npm is everything but it is not node package manager.
npm is manages packages, but it is not node package manager.
npm is the repository, for all the standard packages.

package.json = configuration for the npm

The most important dependency we need inside our project is bundler.
Before going in the our project needs to be minified, our codes need to be bundled.

Webpack, parcel, veet = Bundler

npx create react app = uses webpack behind the seens to bundle the HTML, CSS, JS & Images files

There are two type dependencies we can install:
1. dev dependencies = required for development phase
2. Normal dependencies = used in production also.


. What is the difference between ~ and ^ in package.json?
~version = Approximately equivalent to version, i.e., only accept new patch versions 
^version = Compatible with version, i.e., accept new minor and patch versions 

package-lock.json = keeps a record of every exact version of the dependency which is installed.
Keeps the track of exact version that is being installed. 
keeps the track of all the versions of all the dependencies.

We dont put /node_modules folder into the github.
we only put package.json and package-lock.json files pushed to the github because using this two files
we can regenerate the node_modules.

Whatever you can regenerate don;t put it on the git. It should only have essential things.


Building our app using parcel:
npx parcel index.html (source file)

npm = install the package we use the ( npm install package-name )
but if you want to execute this package
npx = for executing the packages we use npx. 
(npx parcel package-name) = for bundling/executing package use this command

Using CDN links is not a good way to get react and reactDOM inside our project.
1. Fetching from CDN is costly operations.

How Parcel help us?
- Dev Build
- Local Server
- HMR = Hot Module Replacement
- File Watching Algorithm - Written in C++
- Caching - Faster Development Builds 
Parcel is giving faster development builds because it is also does the caching.

When you do 
npx parcel build index.html = you will get an error like below

To remove this error remove main from the package.json

To Run our Production build inside the older versions of the browser
browserlist = it is already installed the node_modules
the browserlist can be useful for to support older versions of the browser.

Why your react app is fast?
How it is optimized.!

What is bundlers?
What is NPM?
What is Parcel? & parcel-cache
What is dist?
What is node_modules?
Why there is package.json & package-lock.json?
How HMR is working?
