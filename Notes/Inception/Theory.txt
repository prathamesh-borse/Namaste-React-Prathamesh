● Difference between a Library and Framework?
Library
* Libraries are basically set of functions that performs set of tasks and developers can use them as per 
  their need.
* Provides functionality that can be called through developers code.
* Eg: JQuery, React

Framework
* Framework is a set of rules, services and architecuture for building applications.
* Here Framework calls the developers code, In library developer can call the library to perform set of
  actions according to his need.
* Developers can extends framework by implementing specific functionalities.
* eg: Spring, Django


● What is CDN? Why do we use it?
* CDN is Content Delivery Network.
* It is a Network of servers that work to deliver the web content such as stylesheets, js files, images
  to user based on their geographical user location.

Key Reasons Why we use CDN?
1. Faster Content Delivery
2. Reduced Server Load
3. Global Availability
4. Scalability
5. Cost Efficiency.

● What is crossorigin in script tag?

● What is diference between React and ReactDOM
React
* React is use for building user interfaces in Javascript Applications.
* React has features like JSX syntax, component based application structure, virtual DOM 
* Developers use React to handle the state, props and overall application structure.

ReactDOM
* ReactDOM is provides DOM specific methods for interacting with DOM (Document Object Model).
* It is responsible for rendering react components inside the browser using the DOM API.
* ReactDOM includes methods like render() which takes a React element and mounts it into the specified 
  DOM node.
* While React is platform-agnostic and can be used for server-side rendering (React Native for mobile, etc.), 
  ReactDOM is specific to web environments where there is a DOM.  


● What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
react.development.js
* This file is useful when developers are developing features in the code 
* And also it does not contains the optimized size making it easier to read and debug.
* This file is mostly useful when development environments. 

react.production.js
* This file is useful when for production when deplying the component of react library.
* And also it contains the optimized version of react library resulting in smaller file size.
* Developers will use file in production for optimized smaller code size and faster loading of the application.
