React = Javascript Library

React.createElement (Object) => (Converted) HTML Element

How our Javascript Works inside the browser?
-> Because the browser already have the javascript engine installed in it and from that engine it has all the superpowers to understand all the javascript code.

What is CDN? 
Why do we use CDN?
What is this cross origin?
-> Content Delivery Network
Websites where the react library is hosted, and we are just pulling react from it to inside our project.


<script
      crossorigin
      src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"
    ></script>


React.createElement = to create new element
ReactDOM.createRoot = to create a root from where Dom manipulation operations will start.

react-dom.development.js
= react-dom is useful for performing the Dom operations using the react.

React.createElement 
= takes 3 parameters, 1. Element you want to element 2. an object 3. The text you want to display on the screen

React Needs to root element, where it can do all the Dom manipulations.

Most Cost List Operation inside our Browser?
= Rearranging the DOM Tree. Adding something on the Dom Tree or Removing Something fro the DOM Tree.  Why React is called a library?
= Because it can work in independently in a small portion of your app as well.

● What is Emmet?
 Emmet is a web development toolkit that helps to accelarte the process of writing html css code.
 Emmet provides shorthand syantax that allows developers to HTML CSS Code faster and as well using 
 emmet you can abbreviations to write Complex structure code of HTML & CSS. 

● Difference between a Library and Framework?
Library
* Libraries are basically set of functions that performs set of tasks and developers can use them as per 
  their need.
* Provides functionality that can be called through developers code.
* Eg: JQuery, React

Framework
* Framework is a set of rules, services and architecuture for building applications.
* Here Framework calls the developers code, In library developer can call the library to perform set of
  actions according to his need.
* Developers can extends framework by implementing specific functionalities.
* eg: Spring, Django


● What is CDN? Why do we use it?
* CDN is Content Delivery Network.
* It is a Network of servers that work to deliver the web content such as stylesheets, js files, images
  to user based on their geographical user location.

Key Reasons Why we use CDN?
1. Faster Content Delivery
2. Reduced Server Load
3. Global Availability
4. Scalability
5. Cost Efficiency.

● Why is React known as React?
Because the main react paradigm is buidling UI Components that react to changes in application state.

● What is crossorigin in script tag?
The crossorigin in script tag controls how browser handles loading scripts from different domain.
The crossorigin attribute allows you to specify how browser should handle loading scripts from different
orgin. 


● What is diference between React and ReactDOM
React
* React is use for building user interfaces in Javascript Applications.
* React has features like JSX syntax, component based application structure, virtual DOM 
* Developers use React to handle the state, props and overall application structure.

ReactDOM
* ReactDOM is provides DOM specific methods for interacting with DOM (Document Object Model).
* It is responsible for rendering react components inside the browser using the DOM API.
* ReactDOM includes methods like render() which takes a React element and mounts it into the specified 
  DOM node.
* While React is platform-agnostic and can be used for server-side rendering (React Native for mobile, etc.), 
  ReactDOM is specific to web environments where there is a DOM.  


● What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
react.development.js
* This file is useful when developers are developing features in the code 
* And also it does not contains the optimized size making it easier to read and debug.
* This file is mostly useful when development environments. 

react.production.js
* This file is useful when for production when deplying the component of react library.
* And also it contains the optimized version of react library resulting in smaller file size.
* Developers will use file in production for optimized smaller code size and faster loading of the application.
