Why to use react?
=> react gives you superpowers so that you can make large scalable production ready
   performance applications.

Never use the hardcoded string, inside your code.

Two Types of Export/IMport

- Default Export/IMport
  
  export default Component;
  import Component from "path";

- Named Export/IMport
  
  export const Component;
  import {Component} from "path";


Can I use named export and export default at the same time? H/W

Data and UI Layer consistent to each other = react comes in picture.

Why react is faster?
Because it has virtual DOM. It have the diff Algorithm and because of this it can do the 
efficient DOM Manipulation.

- Faster DOM Manipulation
- Efficient DOM Manipulation

Hooks in React?
Hook => Normal JavaScript Function => Comes with SuperPowers which is given by react.
- useState()
- useEffect()

1. useState()
takes two variables:
1. list of the Data
2. is the function through which the data will be modified based on the filter which we want to show on the UI

Whenever the state variable updates, react re-renders the Component.

Reconciliation Algorithm => React Fiber => introduced in react 16

Virtual DOM => is the actual representation of the actual DOM.

Diff Algorithm = it finds out the difference between the actual DOM & Updated Virtual DOM

Incremental Rendering
